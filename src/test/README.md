## 1. Introduction
TaskStream AI uses a multi-layered testing approach to ensure reliability, security, and performance across both AI-centric and standard software components. This documentation covers:
• End-to-end testing strategies (unit, integration, e2e, performance, security).  
• Our AI/ML testing pipelines, including performance metrics and specialized test scenarios.  
• Configuration details for the local development and CI/CD pipelines.  
• Adherence to enterprise-level code quality, security scanning, and coverage thresholds (≥80%).  

This guide directly addresses multiple requirements across the TaskStream AI platform:
• Code Quality Standards (≥80% coverage with Jest/Pytest).  
• Development Environment Setup (local environment configuration, environment variables).  
• Test Environment Setup (in-memory, containerized, or mock-based resources).  
• Security Testing (OWASP ZAP, vulnerability scanners).  
• Performance Monitoring (Prometheus, custom metrics).  

---

## 2. Code Quality Standards
Our code quality guidelines are enforced through both static analysis and robust test coverage:

1. Minimum Coverage Threshold:  
   • We mandate a minimum of 80% coverage across lines, functions, branches, and statements.  
   • The Jest configuration (see [jest.config.ts](./jest.config.ts)) enforces coverage thresholds globally.  

2. Linting and Formatting:  
   • We recommend ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript with the Airbnb config.  
   • Use Prettier or Black for consistent formatting.  

3. Continuous Integration Checks:  
   • GitHub Actions runs jest@29.x across multiple test suites.  
   • Pull requests must pass coverage thresholds and lint checks.  

4. Reporting and Threshold Monitoring:  
   • Coverage reports are generated in /coverage and can be exported as HTML, LCOV, or Cobertura.  
   • The jest-performance/reporter plugin helps ensure performance-specific thresholds (e.g., max execution time).  

---

## 3. Development Environment Setup
Local development and testing leverage Docker containers, Node.js scripts, and environment variables to match production-like expectations:

1. Prerequisites:  
   • Node.js v18+ and Yarn/PNPM for dependency management.  
   • Docker (v24+) for container-based database testing (used by testcontainers).  
   • Optional: Python 3.11+ if you are integrating advanced AI/ML tooling within local scripts.

2. Environment Variables:  
   • A dedicated .env.test file that includes test-specific credentials, ports, and feature flags.  
   • The environment variable NODE_ENV should remain set to test for consistency.  

3. Local Testing Flow:  
   • Run “yarn install” or “npm install” to fetch dependencies.  
   • A typical local test run:  
     ```
     yarn test
     ```  
   • Spin up ephemeral containers for PostgreSQL or other services automatically via testcontainers if integration tests require them.  

4. Advanced AI/ML Testing Setup (Optional Local Tools):  
   • GPU support through Docker or local frameworks if testing large-scale NLP or model inferencing.  
   • Additional Python-based frameworks for offline ML checks.

## 4. Test Environment Setup
Our main test environment configuration references internally defined scripts to prepare, bootstrap, and clean up:

1. Global Setup Script:
   • In [test-setup.ts](./utils/test-setup.ts), the default export function (globalSetup) is invoked before all Jest test suites to initialize environment variables, set up containerized databases, seed mock data, and configure monitoring.
   • Example:
     ```
     // Pseudocode reference
     import globalSetup from './utils/test-setup';
     globalSetup().then(() => {
       // All environment dependencies are ready
     });
     ```

2. Per-Suite Environment:
   • The named function “setupTestEnvironment” is exported from [test-setup.ts](./utils/test-setup.ts) to provide a more granular environment configuration for each suite. 
   • It enforces the correct NODE_ENV, optionally re-checks DB readiness, and can set up ephemeral route mocks for integration tests.

3. Cleanup / Teardown:
   • Although the JSON specification references teardownTestEnvironment, no direct teardown function is implemented in test-setup.ts. Resource cleanup is handled by container stop calls, process.exit hooks, or usage of the globalSetup’s cleanup steps.
   • The mismatch is noted for future expansions if additional tear-down logic is needed.

4. AI Test Environment Setup:
   • The specification also references a setupAITestEnvironment function. Currently, [test-setup.ts](./utils/test-setup.ts) does not implement it. Future releases may add specialized AI test harness initialization, GPU resource checks, or advanced data seeding for model testing.

5. Additional Utility Functions:
   • We also export “setupGlobalMocks” from [test-setup.ts](./utils/test-setup.ts) for unified mocking strategies across APIs, databases, or external services. This is helpful for multiple test suites that require a consistent mocked environment.

## 5. AI & ML Testing Capabilities
Given TaskStream AI’s emphasis on intelligent project management, specialized tests ensure AI/ML functionality is robust and accurate:

1. AI/ML-Specific Repositories:  
   • Our NLP and analytics modules require integration tests focusing on natural language extraction, classification accuracy, and sentiment analysis (≥95% target from spec).

2. AI Test Coverage:  
   • Per the Code Quality Standards, ML or AI modules tested with jest@29.x must maintain ≥80% coverage.  
   • Additional coverage or performance instrumentation is recommended using jest-performance or ephemeral GPU-based pipelines.

3. Testing Approach:
   • Synthetic Data Generation: In [mock-data.ts](./utils/mock-data.ts), factories like createMockTask or createMockProject can produce tasks with AI metadata fields (confidence, extracted entities, sentiments).  
   • Model Validation: Freed to configure specialized “ai” or “nlp” test projects under the multi-project arrangement in [jest.config.ts](./jest.config.ts).  
   • Performance: Use k6@0.45.x or custom performance test scripts to confirm model inference times remain under acceptable thresholds.

## 6. Security Testing
Security is paramount to TaskStream AI. Automated scanning and penetration testing tools help ensure vulnerabilities are detected early:

1. Automated Scanners:
   • For dynamic security testing, OWASP ZAP is integrated (per the JSON specification “framework”: “OWASP ZAP”).  
   • We recommend weekly or per-build scanning for new or changed endpoints.

2. Vulnerability Scanning:
   • Tools like Snyk or similar dependencies are also used in CI to detect library-level vulnerabilities.  
   • Thorough checks are performed on Docker images to confirm no high-severity CVEs remain.

3. Authentication & Permission Tests:
   • The coverage must include negative test scenarios for permission-based endpoints, ensuring no unauthorized access to tasks or projects.  
   • Roles tested: ADMIN, PROJECT_MANAGER, TEAM_LEAD, DEVELOPER, VIEWER (see [auth.interface.ts](../shared/interfaces/auth.interface.ts)).

4. Steps for Security Test Execution:
   • Ensure environment is built with all relevant endpoints exposed.  
   • Run ZAP scanning scripts automatically or from the CI pipeline.  
   • Address any reported vulnerabilities, ensuring test coverage includes new security measures.

## 7. Performance Monitoring
Performance monitoring ensures that TaskStream AI meets service-level objectives:

1. Metrics Collection:
   • Prometheus integration is established via prom-client@14.x.  
   • If “enableMetrics” is set to true (see references in [test-helpers.ts](./utils/test-helpers.ts)), ephemeral counters/gauges track container statuses, database readiness, or custom KPI.

2. k6 Performance Tests:
   • k6@0.45.x is used for load or stress tests (e.g., saved in ./performance).  
   • Scripts can be run to verify RPS capacity or response latency remains within SLA.

3. Monitoring Hooks:
   • Each performance test can optionally push real-time metrics to local or remote Prometheus/Grafana.  
   • The jest-performance/reporter plugin further helps measure test run durations and detect regressions.

## 8. Configuration Files and Internal Imports

### 8.1 jest.config.ts
• Location: [src/test/jest.config.ts](./jest.config.ts)  
• Named Export: `config`, which defines:  
  - Multi-project structure (unit, integration, e2e, performance, security, etc.).  
  - Coverage threshold (≥80%).  
  - Setup files (including test-setup.ts).  
  - Module name mappings and test environment definitions.

Below is an illustrative snippet referencing the coverageThreshold:

```typescript
export const coverageThreshold = config.coverageThreshold;
```
This threshold enforces the code quality standard for all test suites in TaskStream AI.

### 8.2 test-setup.ts
• Location: [src/test/utils/test-setup.ts](./utils/test-setup.ts)  
• Functions:  
  - `setupTestEnvironment(options?)`: Configures or re-configures the environment for test execution.  
  - `setupGlobalMocks()`: Provides a consistent mocking layer for external modules or services.  
  - Default export function `globalSetup()`: One-time global suite initialization.  

Though referenced in the requirement, teardownTestEnvironment and setupAITestEnvironment do not exist in the codebase. Future expansions may add them.

### 8.3 Additional Internals
• test-helpers.ts: Container orchestration for ephemeral Postgres with testcontainers, advanced resource cleanup, mock external service definitions.  
• mock-data.ts: Data factories to facilitate test scenario creation (tasks, projects, analytics, etc.).

## 9. Test Execution Guidelines

1. Running All Tests:
   ```
   yarn test
   ```
   This command triggers the multi-project Jest setup, executing unit, integration, e2e, performance, and security suites as configured.

2. Isolated Suite Runs:
   ```
   yarn test --projects unit
   yarn test --projects integration
   ```
   Each suite can be run individually, focusing coverage checks on specific areas.

3. Generating Coverage Reports:
   • The coverage is output to <rootDir>/coverage by default (HTML, LCOV, JSON-summary, Cobertura).  
   • E.g., open coverage/lcov-report/index.html for an interactive coverage visualization.

4. Running Security Tests:
   • Automated scanning can integrate with your CI or can be invoked manually.  
   • Example command (placeholder):
     ```
     yarn security:scan
     ```
   • If OWASP ZAP or Snyk is used, verify you have credentials or containers configured appropriately.

5. Performance Test Steps:
   • For k6-based performance tests (in ./performance), you can launch a local environment, then:
     ```
     k6 run performance/test-scripts/load-test.js
     ```
   • Use the metrics pipeline (Prometheus + Grafana) to analyze results if enabled.

6. Logging and Debugging:
   • Utilize Winston or console logs to track test progress.  
   • In Docker-based test flows, tail container logs for DB or microservices if needed.
