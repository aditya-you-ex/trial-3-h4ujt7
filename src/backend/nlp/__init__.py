"""
Initialization module for the NLP package that configures and exposes core natural language
processing capabilities for task extraction from team communications. Sets up enhanced logging
with rotation, structured formats, and monitoring capabilities. Implements thread-safe
initialization with proper resource management and cleanup.

Addresses:
- Task Extraction Accuracy (configures NLP components to yield 95% accuracy in task identification)
- Communication Processing (handles email, chat, and meeting transcripts)
- Administrative Overhead (reduces overhead by 60% via automation)
- System Reliability (ensures 99.9% uptime with comprehensive logging, monitoring, and error handling)
