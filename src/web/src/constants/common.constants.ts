/**
 * TaskStream AI - Common Constants
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This file defines shared constants, default configurations, and reference
 * values used throughout the TaskStream AI web application. It addresses:
 *
 * 1. User Interface Design - By providing UI constants such as loading states,
 *    animation timings, and default date/time formats for consistent design.
 * 2. API Response Standards - By mapping standardized HTTP status codes and
 *    custom error codes for uniform client-server communication.
 * 3. System Architecture - Ensuring essential settings like pagination and
 *    sort direction are consistently applied across the applicationâ€™s React,
 *    Redux, and other frontend layers.
 *
 * Note:
 * - Importing "StatusCodes" from "http-status-codes" (version ^2.2.0) to
 *   maintain alignment with widely used HTTP conventions.
 * - Importing "LoadingState" and "SortDirection" from "../types/common.types"
 *   based on the provided specification.
