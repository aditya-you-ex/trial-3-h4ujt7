 * TaskStream AI - Enterprise-Grade API Type Definitions
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This file provides TypeScript types and interfaces for API communication between the frontend
 * and backend services. It includes endpoint definitions, HTTP configuration (with retry and
 * circuit breaker patterns), enhanced monitoring/tracing support, and standardized request/response
 * models. These types are central to ensuring reliable, strongly typed, and robust interactions
 * across the TaskStream AI platform.
