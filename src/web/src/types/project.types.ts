 * Enumeration: ProjectStatus

 * Purpose:

 *   of a project. The system leverages these states for display, filtering,
 *   and workflow logic.

 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Purpose:

 *   to optimize resource allocation.
 * 
 * Description:
 *   The resource allocation is represented as a map of resource identifier
 *   (e.g. developer ID, machine ID) to numeric usage. Performance metrics
 *   can be any number-based KPI, such as velocity or throughput. Bottlenecks
 *   highlight constraints within the project.
