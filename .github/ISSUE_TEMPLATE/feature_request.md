# Feature Request Submission

Thank you for proposing a new feature for TaskStream AI! Please provide as much detail as possible in the sections below. This will ensure thorough evaluation, expedite development, and maintain our high standards of accuracy and integration readiness.

---

## 1. Feature Description (REQUIRED)

<!--
  Comprehensive description of the proposed feature (minimum total length: 200 characters).
  Fields to address:
    - What is the feature?
    - Problem it solves
    - Target users/stakeholders
    - Impact analysis (tie to "User Adoption" or "Task Extraction Accuracy" if relevant)
    - System integration points (address "Enterprise Integration" requirements where applicable)
-->

> **Note:** Please verify this section meets the minimum length requirement (200 characters).

---

## 2. Business Value (REQUIRED)

<!--
  Detailed business justification with quantifiable metrics:
    - Expected benefits
    - Quantifiable success metrics (user adoption, ROI, etc.)
    - ROI calculation template
    - User impact assessment
    - Resource utilization projection
-->

> **Hint:** Include ROI estimations and direct references to user engagement or throughput gains.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution (REQUIRED)

<!--
  Technical solution proposal (architecture details, diagrams, etc.):
    - Implementation approach
    - Technical architecture (include references or sketches if possible)
    - Integration requirements (APIs, modules, data flows)
    - Data flow diagram
    - Security considerations (potentially referencing LOG_LEVELS if advanced logging is needed)
-->

> **Tip:** Consider how this solution will scale and any configuration needed for external tool integration.

---

## 4. Acceptance Criteria (REQUIRED)

<!--
  Comprehensive definition of "done":
    - Functional requirements
    - Performance requirements
    - Security requirements
    - Testing criteria (unit, integration, end-to-end)
    - Integration validation
-->

> **Reminder:** Clearly stated acceptance criteria help maintain the 95% task extraction accuracy target.

---

## 5. Technical Considerations (REQUIRED)

<!--
  Detailed technical requirements:
    - Architecture impact analysis
    - Security compliance checklist
    - Performance benchmarks
    - Scalability requirements
    - Monitoring requirements (including usage of LOG_LEVELS if relevant)
-->

> **Note:** Include any expected logging levels from LOG_LEVELS if the feature requires special trace or debug logs.

---

## 6. Dependencies (REQUIRED)

<!--
  Comprehensive dependency mapping:
    - System dependencies (libraries, frameworks, environment specs)
    - External integrations (3rd party services, enterprise tools)
    - Team dependencies (DevOps, QA, design)
    - Timeline dependencies (release schedule, sprints)
    - Resource requirements (hardware, budget, specialized expertise)
-->

---

## 7. Additional Context (OPTIONAL)

<!--
  Supplementary information and references:
    - Alternative solutions
    - Related features
    - Documentation links
    - Mockups/Diagrams
    - Implementation notes
-->
