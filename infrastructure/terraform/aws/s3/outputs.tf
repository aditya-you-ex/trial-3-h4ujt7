# Terraform Outputs for AWS S3 Buckets
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# (IE2) External Library Version:
#   - terraform (hashicorp/terraform) ~> 1.5
#
# This file exports essential attributes for the AWS S3 buckets used within
# TaskStream AIâ€™s infrastructure. These outputs enable other modules or
# stacks to reference bucket names, ARNs, domains, and lifecycle settings
# for critical features such as document storage, static asset hosting, and
# backup retention policies. Each output aligns with enterprise security
# and compliance requirements (SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001).
#
# References to resources in main.tf:
#   - aws_s3_bucket.document_storage   (Confidential docs & cross-region replication)
#   - aws_s3_bucket.static_assets      (Public/Static site hosting)
#   - aws_s3_bucket.backup_storage     (Restricted backups & lifecycle policies)
#
# All outputs are explicitly marked as non-sensitive unless otherwise required
# by the compliance constraints. This code strictly adheres to the enterprise
# standards from the Technical Specifications documentation, including sections
# on data storage (4.3.2) and security compliance (7.1).
