# TaskStream AI Infrastructure Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive infrastructure documentation for the TaskStream AI platform. This README provides a detailed guide to setting up, deploying, and maintaining the multi-region, enterprise-grade cloud and Kubernetes environments for TaskStream AI. It is designed to address SOC 2 Type II compliance, robust security controls, high availability, and containerization requirements in production scenarios.

Below you will find all essential information on prerequisites, AWS infrastructure configuration (including references to our internal Terraform modules such as “vpc_configuration,” “eks_configuration,” and “security_groups” within main.tf), Kubernetes cluster setup (with “namespace_configuration” and “network_policies” from namespaces.yaml), deployment procedures, maintenance best practices, and security guidelines.

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope
TaskStream AI’s infrastructure is built to support a platform that converts natural communications into structured tasks, analytics, and documentation. This setup leverages:
• Multi-region AWS deployment for global availability (covering regions such as us-east-1, eu-west-1, and ap-southeast-1).  
• Amazon EKS for container orchestration and auto-scaling.  
• Strong security with encryption at rest, ephemeral service accounts, restricted network policies, and strict RBAC.  
• Monitoring and alerting solutions for both infrastructure and application layers.  

This documentation focuses on five key requirements:  
1) Multi-Region Deployment (Technical Specifications/8.1).  
2) Cloud Infrastructure (Technical Specifications/8.2).  
3) Containerization (Technical Specifications/8.3).  
4) Security Architecture (Technical Specifications/7).  
5) Infrastructure Monitoring (Technical Specifications/8.4).

### 1.2 Infrastructure Components and Relationships
At a high level, the TaskStream AI environment consists of:  
• A fully configured VPC (via Terraform) with subnets spread across multiple Availability Zones, leveraging the “vpc_configuration” resource from main.tf.  
• EKS clusters provisioned by the “eks_configuration” resource block, automatically deploying node groups across private subnets.  
• Security groups (“security_groups” from main.tf) enforce controlled ingress and egress rules for each service.  
• Namespaces and network policies defined in namespaces.yaml, referencing “namespace_configuration” and “network_policies,” isolate workloads (analytics, nlp, tasks, monitoring, integration).  
• Additional services such as RDS, ElastiCache, and S3 are leveraged for data persistence and caching, with KMS encryption at rest.  

Below is an outline of the steps and configurations needed to set up and keep this system secure, scalable, and compliant with enterprise norms.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before deploying the infrastructure, ensure you have the following:

1. An AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions for creating VPCs, subnets, EKS clusters, and security groups.
2. Terraform 1.5+ installed locally (or in your CI/CD environment).  
3. Kubectl 1.27+ for managing Kubernetes clusters.  
4. AWS CLI (v2.x) configured with your credentials.  
5. (Optional) Helm 3.x for installing additional Kubernetes packages or charts.  
6. Basic knowledge of Git, plus a repository hosting the Terraform code (including main.tf and submodules).  
7. Network prerequisites:  
   • Ability to create or configure custom DNS for the multi-region setup.  
   • Proper external egress rules and NAT gateways for private subnets (described in the “vpc_configuration” code).  

### 2.1 Compliance-Related Setup
• Make sure all relevant SOC 2 Type II logging requirements are turned on (VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, Config, etc.).  
• Plan for global load balancing or Route 53 latency-based routing if cross-region traffic distribution is required.  
• Obtain KMS CMKs for encryption (Terraform “kms” module), as mandated in the environment’s compliance scope.

## 3. AWS Infrastructure

### 3.1 Multi-Region Layout
• Regions Covered:  
  1. us-east-1 (primary region)  
  2. eu-west-1 (Europe)  
  3. ap-southeast-1 (Asia-Pacific)  
• Subnets are carved out across multiple Availability Zones in each region.  
• Cross-region replication or read replicas may be configured for RDS Aurora (PostgreSQL 14+).  

### 3.2 Core Terraform Modules
This platform’s core AWS infrastructure is built via Terraform modules referenced in main.tf. Key elements include:

1. **VPC Configuration (“vpc_configuration” from main.tf)**  
   • Creates a multi-AZ VPC with public, private, and database subnets.  
   • Enables VPC Flow Logs for auditing traffic.  
   • Supports NAT gateways or single NAT usage depending on environment.  
   • Example:  
     ```hcl
     module "vpc" {
       source             = "./vpc"
       project            = var.project
       environment        = var.environment
       vpc_cidr           = var.vpc_cidr
       availability_zones = var.availability_zones
       enable_flow_logs   = true
       # ...
     }
     ```
   • Subnets are used by EKS, RDS, ElastiCache, and other services.

2. **EKS Configuration (“eks_configuration” from main.tf)**  
   • Provisions the Amazon EKS cluster in private subnets.  
   • Enables cluster logging (api, audit, authenticator, etc.).  
   • Integrates with KMS for secrets encryption at rest.  
   • Establishes node groups with custom scaling policies, instance types, and resource constraints.

3. **Security Groups (“security_groups” from main.tf)**  
   • Strict inbound and outbound rules, ensuring tasks and analytics pods only communicate with authorized services.  
   • SOC 2 Type II requirement: Logging and auditing of connection attempts are enforced through these security groups, in tandem with Flow Logs and other monitoring approaches.  

### 3.3 Additional AWS Resources
• **RDS Aurora (PostgreSQL 14+)**  
  • Spin up multi-AZ clusters for persistent data.  
  • Auto minor version upgrades and 35-day automated backups.  
  • KMS-managed CMKs for encryption.  
• **ElastiCache** for Redis:  
  • Speedy caching layer for ephemeral data.  
• **S3** for data lake, static files, or artifact storage.  
• **CloudWatch** for logs and metrics, along with Datadog or Prometheus bridging for advanced telemetry.

## 4. Kubernetes Setup

### 4.1 Overview of Containerization
TaskStream AI uses Docker containers orchestrated by Amazon EKS (Kubernetes 1.27+). Each microservice is packaged in a container with its dependencies. This approach streamlines:
• Autoscaling based on CPU or memory usage.  
• Deployment rollouts and rollbacks.  
• Workload isolation and zero-downtime updates.  

### 4.2 Namespaces and Network Policies  
We define multiple namespaces for isolation and compliance. The “namespace_configuration” from namespaces.yaml creates the following:
• analytics  
• nlp  
• tasks  
• monitoring  
• integration  

Each namespace includes “network_policies” enforcing zero-trust boundaries:
• Only specific pods (e.g., role=api in tasks) may talk to analytics pods on restricted ports.  
• NLP pods can receive traffic only from legitimate data processing or monitoring endpoints.  
• Monitoring obtains cluster-wide read access for metrics but has minimal egress.  

### 4.3 RBAC and Security Context
• RBAC definitions live in rbac.yaml, specifying Roles/ClusterRoles and matching RoleBindings/ClusterRoleBindings for service accounts.  
• Each microservice typically has a dedicated service account with minimal privileges.  
• Pod Security Policies or (in newer clusters) Pod Security Admission rules ensure only restricted synonyms are permitted by default, except for specialized system workloads.  

### 4.4 EKS Node Groups
• “eks_configuration” references advanced node group configurations within main.tf for application, system, or GPU workloads.  
• The tasks or analytics node pools typically run on t3.xlarge or c5.xlarge.  
• The nlp node pool may use GPU-based instance types to handle heavier ML processing.  
• Resource constraints and custom labels/taints ensure job scheduling on appropriate nodes with minimal cross-service interference.

## 5. Deployment

### 5.1 Secure Infrastructure Provisioning
1. **Clone the Infrastructure Repository**:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/taskstream-infra.git
   cd taskstream-infra
   ```
2. **Terraform Initialization**:  
   ```
   terraform init
   ```
   This downloads modules like terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws (for “vpc_configuration”), AWS provider ~> 5.0, etc.
3. **Plan and Apply**:  
   ```
   terraform plan -out=planfile.tfplan
   terraform apply planfile.tfplan
   ```
   Verify the output references for `vpc_id`, `eks_cluster_endpoint`, `rds_cluster_endpoint`, etc.

### 5.2 Application Deployment onto EKS
1. **Update kubeconfig** (once Terraform has created the EKS cluster):  
   ```
   aws eks --region us-east-1 update-kubeconfig --name <cluster_name>
   ```
2. **Validate your cluster**:  
   ```
   kubectl get nodes -A
   kubectl get namespaces
   ```
3. **Deploy core Kubernetes objects**:  
   - Apply the namespaces.yaml for “namespace_configuration.”  
   - Apply rbac.yaml and network-policies.yaml for security boundaries.  
   - Deploy your microservices with Helm or kubectl (e.g., `helm install analytics ./charts/analytics`).  

### 5.3 Configuration Management
• Use environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive credentials.  
• Overwrite default charts or deployment YAMLs using Values files if customizing memory/CPU/gpu.  
• For multi-region expansions, replicate or reference the same Terraform modules, adjusting variables for secondary regions.

## 6. Maintenance

### 6.1 Backup and Recovery
• Aurora PostgreSQL backups are retained for at least 35 days (configurable up to 90 days).  
• Snapshots can be regularly scheduled for cross-region or cross-account.  
• EKS cluster state is ephemeral; ensure workload definitions are in Git or a config repo.  

### 6.2 Patching and Updates
1. **Terraform Modules**: Update versions in main.tf, re-run plan/apply to patch VPC, EKS, or RDS modules.  
2. **Kubernetes**: Upgrade EKS cluster versions periodically (1.27 → higher).  
3. **Node OS Patching**: Use managed node groups or custom AMI pipelines to keep OS images updated.  

### 6.3 Monitoring and Alerting
• **Datadog or Prometheus/Grafana** used for collecting metrics across pods, nodes, and RDS instances.  
• Alarms or alerts in CloudWatch or Datadog for CPU usage, memory usage, 5xx error rates, or custom logs.  
• Additional vantage into security events using VPC Flow Logs or AWS GuardDuty.  

### 6.4 Incident Response
• Document all EKS cluster logs (audit, authenticator, etc.).  
• Store logs in an immutable location (e.g., S3 + Glacier) for post-incident analysis.  
• Maintain runbooks referencing which Terraform resources to shut down or reconfigure during data breaches or major disruptions.

## 7. Security

### 7.1 Architecture and WAN Security
• All external traffic is routed through an ALB or NAT gateways in public subnets.  
• The “security_groups” resource from main.tf strictly allows minimal inbound exposures.  
• Lateral movements are further contained by the “network_policies” in each namespace, preventing unauthorized cross-service chatter.

### 7.2 Data Protection and Encryption
• KMS CMKs enforce AES-256 at rest for RDS, EBS volumes, and S3 storage.  
• TLS 1.3 in transit for all external endpoints.  
• By default, no pods run as root (restricted Pod Security Policies), significantly reducing container breakout risks.

### 7.3 Identity and Access Management
• Terraform code references AWS IAM roles with restricted policies for EKS.  
• Service accounts in tasks, analytics, nlp, monitoring, etc. are mapped to IAM roles (using IRSA if desired).  
• Access to the cluster and node groups requires short-lived credentials with regular rotation.  

### 7.4 Auditing and Logging
• SOC 2 Type II compliance:  
  1. CloudTrail logs capturing all API calls.  
  2. GuardDuty for threat detection.  
  3. Config for resource configuration changes.  
• VPC Flow Logs store network traffic data for incident forensics.  
• EKS control-plane logs: (api, audit, authenticator, controllerManager, scheduler) are directed to CloudWatch or third-party SIEM.

### 7.5 Penetration Testing
• Conduct quarterly third-party pentests.  
• Perform monthly vulnerability scans on container images via tools like Snyk or Trivy.  
• Continually review RBAC, PSP (or Pod Security Admission), and network policy updates for potential misconfigurations.
